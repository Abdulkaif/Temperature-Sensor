# Temperature Sensor - RaspberryPi Pico

This repository contains a temperature sensor project implemented in MicroPython. The project aims to read temperature data from a sensor and perform various operations on the data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the temperature sensor project, follow these steps:

```
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Abdulkaif/Temperature-Sensor.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Connect the temperature sensor to your system.
Run the script you want.
```

## Features

- Read temperature data from the sensor.
- Calculate the average temperature.
- Print the current temperatures.
- Display the current temperatures on 16X2 LCD Panel (if connected).
#### Note: To display the current temperatures on 16X2 LCD Panel run 'display temperature on lcd.py' AND To print the current temperatures run 'onboard_temp.py'.
